        <p>
            MY NAME IS FERNANDO GARCIA AND I WILL BE A JUNIOR AT GEORGE WASHINGTON HIGH SCHOOL I JOINED THE NEXTECH PROGRAM TO LEARN HOW TO CODE.
I WAS INTRODUCED TO CODING IN THIRD GRADE WHEN MY TECHNOLOGY TEACHER INTRODUCED ME TO A WEBSITE CALLED CODE.ORG WHERE I PLAYED CODING GAMES ON CODE STUDIO.
WHAT I HOPE TO GAIN FROM THIS PROGRAM IS TO LEARN HOW TO CODE WEBSITES, AND GET CAREER OPPORTUNITIES THAT INVOLVE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT OR COMPUTER SCIENCE.
THE REASON THAT I AM INTERESTED IN THESE TYPES OF CAREERS IS THAT EVER SINCE I WAS LITTLE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INTRIGUED WITH VIDEO GAMES AND WEBSITES AND HOW IT WAS CREATED.
